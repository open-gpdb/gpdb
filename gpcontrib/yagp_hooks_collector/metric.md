## YAGP Hooks Collector Metrics

### States
A Postgres process goes through 4 executor functions to execute a query:
1) `ExecutorStart()` - resource allocation for the query.
2) `ExecutorRun()` - query execution.
3) `ExecutorFinish()` - cleanup.
4) `ExecutorEnd()` - cleanup.

yagp-hooks-collector sends messages with 4 states, from _Dispatcher_ and/or _Execute_ processes: `submit`, `start`, `end`, `done`, in this order:
```
submit -> ExecutorStart() -> start -> ExecutorRun() -> ExecutorFinish() -> end -> ExecutorEnd() -> done
```

### Key Points
- Some queries may skip the _end_ state, then the _end_ statistics is sent during _done_.
- If a query finishes with an error (`METRICS_QUERY_ERROR`), or is cancelled (`METRICS_QUERY_CANCELLED`), statistics is sent at _done_.
- Some statistics is calculated as the difference between the current global metric and the previous. The initial snapshot is taken at submit, and at _end_/_done_ the diff is calculated.
- Nested queries on _Dispatcher_ become top-level on _Execute_.
- Each process (_Dispatcher_/_Execute_) sends its own statistics

### Notations
- **S** = Submit event.
- **T** = Start event.
- **E** = End event.
- **D** = Done event.
- **DIFF** = current_value - submit_value (submit event).
- **ABS** = Absolute value, or where diff is not applicable, the value taken.
- **Local*** - Statistics that starts counting from zero for each new query. A nested query is also considered new.
- **Node** - PG process, either a `Query Dispatcher` (on master) or an `Execute` (on segment).
