-- test scenario

-- The test is to validate crash recovery can be completed after AO table
-- relfilenode file and its segments were removed by pg_rewind.
-- The scenario is when a checkpoint is executing on the primary segment,
-- a bunch of insert requests are received so generate a lot of insertion
-- XLOG records between the REO point and the LSN of the current checkpoint.
-- The primary segment then crashed after the checkpoint completed.
-- After the mirror segment is promoted to new primary, a truncate request
-- is received to truncate this AO table. Then both old relfilenode and its
-- segment files are removed when executing gprecoverseg.
-- On the old primary (new mirror), those files are also removed but only
-- the old refilenode segment files will be re-generated due to the insert
-- records during WAL replay. This will queue fsync request to checkpointer
-- and will not be forgotten in later flush. Later restart point creation will
-- flush the buffer to disk and expect to access the AO old base relfilenode
-- file (.0), while it was removed by pg_rewind previously, therefore PANIC
-- at mdsync during creating restart point.
-- The fix is intended to remove the logic of accessing the base relfilenode
-- file when the target is a segment file in the above fsync scenario.
