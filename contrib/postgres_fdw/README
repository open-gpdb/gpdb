Test
===========================================
There are 3 tests in this dir:

1) postgres_fdw, this is the upstream test.
A Postgres database uses postgres_fdw to connect to
itself. There is no need for us to run it. We just
keep it the same as the upstream.

2) gp2pg_postgres_fdw, this is the Greenplum
specific test. A Greenplum database uses postgres_fdw
to connect to a Postgres database.
In this test case, we need to set up a Postgres
server by postgres_setup.sh, and run some test
SQL in Postgres database to create remote tables
and triggers, these SQL files are in sql/postgres_sql.

3) gp_postgres_fdw. This test is used to test
the MPP feature of postgres_fdw. A Greenplum database
uses postgres_fdw to connect to itself. However
this feature is not implemented completely. We just
leave the case there untill we starts working on
postgres_fdw's MPP feature.
