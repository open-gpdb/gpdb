title: log\_alert\_\* 
---

The `log_alert_*` tables store `pg_log` errors and warnings.

See [Alert Log Processing and Log Rotation](dbref.md#section_ok2_wd1_41b) for information about configuring the system logger for `gpperfmon`.

There are three `log_alert` tables, all having the same columns:

-   `log_alert_now` is an external table whose data is stored in `.csv` files in the `$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/gpperfmon/logs` directory. Current `pg_log` errors and warnings data are available in `log_alert_now` during the period between data collection from the `gpperfmon` agents and automatic commitment to the `log_alert_history` table.
-   `log_alert_tail` is an external table with data stored in `$MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY/gpperfmon/logs/alert_log_stage`. This is a transitional table for data that has been cleared from `log_alert_now` but has not yet been committed to `log_alert_history`. The table includes records from all alert logs except the most recent. It typically contains only a few minutes' worth of data.
-   `log_alert_history` is a regular table that stores historical database-wide errors and warnings data. It is pre-partitioned into monthly partitions. Partitions are automatically added in two month increments as needed.
